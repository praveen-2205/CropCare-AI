# 🌱 CropCare AI
## A Data Science and Deep Learning Project

CropCare AI is a deep learning and data science project designed to classify potato plant leaves into three categories: **Healthy**, **Early Blight**, and **Late Blight**.I made two models leveraging **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, one using **Data Augmentation** and another using **ImageDatagenerator**. **Tensorflow pipelines** was used for Data Preprocessing and was also **optimized using cache and prefetch**. This project aims to assist farmers and agriculturists in identifying diseases early, ensuring better crop health and yield.
